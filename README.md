# Mealy

Trying to make my life easier by removing the need to decide what to cook for dinner.

## Intended features

A list of the basic functionality I want to implement:
1. ~~Actually turn the list of meals into a meal plan like the application is supposed to.~~ **DONE**
2. ~~Utilise the weighting field to make some meals more likely than others.~~ **DONE**
3. --Add the ingredients and generate shopping lists based on the contents of the `ingredients` JSON field.-- **DONE**
4. Add cooking instructions to the provided meals.json examples.
5. Reduce the liklihood of repeated ingredients from day to day (So I don't eat pasta all week...).
6. Write tests.

## Possible features

If I don't abandon this project before it does the basic features...
1. Make the output pretty... (A web front end? Well formatted text? Not sure yet...)
2. Add which meal type the meal is to generate more than just dinner.
